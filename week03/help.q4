Generates one or more randomly generated DNA sequences of the given length and
either prints the sequences or outputs them to files.

Usage: q4.pl [switches] length [num]

        :: ARGUMENTS ::
  length    Length for the sequence(s) to generate.
  num       Number of sequences to generate.  If none is given, defaults to 1.

        :: SWITCHES ::
  -f        Exports each sequence to a file with the name "seq#".  If potential
            conflicts are found, the files will be named according to the
            format "seq#.X" instead, where "X" indicates the run number
            (starting with 1 for the second run).  For example, if running for
            the fourth time, the files will be labeled as "seq#.3".

  -o        Program runs in Overwrite mode. It will NOT prompt the user in the
            event of a file conflict and will overwrite the pre-existing file.

  -r        Randomize the sequence length(s) to be a number between 1 and the
            given length.

  -h        Prints this help text (also prints by default if no argument is
            provided).

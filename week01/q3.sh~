# Basic directory tree creator.
#
# Creates a project directory tree.  If given an argument, uses that
# argument as the project name, otherwise the tool assigns the new
# project a name by appending ".#", where "#" is a number achieved by
# looping through the numbers 1-20 and finding the first that does NOT
# create a conflict when appended to the project name..  The tool will
# also automatically skip over project names that are already present
# if no project name is provided.  If a project name *is* provided, it
# will prompt the user if it should overwrite the existing project or
# create a new project directory tree.
#
# The tool also takes the '-q' parameter, which triggers "quiet mode."
# This causes the tool to assume that any conflicts should be resolved
# by creating new projects.

q_mode=0
# Default Project Name variable
p_dflt="my_proj"

# Full directory path.

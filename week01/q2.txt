I chose Emacs as my editor of preference for this class.  I much
prefer its innate editing capabilities as opposed to the vi paradigm
of "use a key to enter/exit editing modes".  I'd write more, but that
was really the only thing that I found as a preference.  (Honestly,
given my druthers, I'd have chosen Notepad++ or the Eclipse IDE with
the EPIC plugin for Perl, but that's my own preferences/prejudices
talking.  =P)
